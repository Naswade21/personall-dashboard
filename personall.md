## **Introduction**

### **Overview**

- Talked with wife about building chrome dashboard that would allow her to be 2x productive at work, can view, update and remove upcoming meetings, a to-do list, and can play a game of Wordle when she has time.

### **Glossary/Terminology**

- Pomodoro -> 25 minute blocks of work followed by 5 minutes of break. After four 25 minute blocks, a 15 minute break is followed

### **Context/Background**

- **Reasons it's worth solving**
    1. When she has multiple meetings or people go into her office it can cause her to get off task. A timer and a to-do list to keep track can help with that
    2. Meetings are a large portion of her work, and having a dashboard that shows meetings where she can update, view and remove allows her to stay on top of meetings as people schedule time or other staff schedule with her.
    3. When she does have time to herself, a personalized Wordle would be a fun outlet to stay refreshed, have fun and continue to be productive when she has to work
    4. As an amazing wife, sometimes she tries to do a lot and a to-do list on her main laptop that uses most of the day will keep her on track. A way to tackle personal to-do's and work to-do's are perfect for this.

### **Goals and Technical Requirements**

**Goals**

- Increase in productivity when at work so she can reduce stress and on breaks to focus on drinking water/standing up
- Enjoy her favorite game when she is idle or completed most of her tasks
- Easily manage her meetings on a day-to-day basis

**Product Requirements**

- Include Google Auth to ensure she can attach her Calendars

**Technical Requirements**

- LocalSotrage will be used to save to-do lists and be accessed whenever

- Integrate Google Authentication to sync calendar data and key access

- Supports 1 individual user, may turn into a product in the future

- API's must be fetched and loaded within 200ms to feel natural when a new chrome tab is opened

### **Out of Scope**

- A backend will not be incorporated in initial build

- No database will be incorporated in initial build and LocalStorage will be used to store data

- Technical SEO will not be focused on due to it being a dashboard

### **Future Goals**

- Add Accessibility capabilities

- Upload to Chrome Web Store for anyone to use

- Focus on UX to ensure app is enjoyable for multiple users

### **Assumptions**

- N/A

## **Solutions**

### **Current Solution**

- N/A

### **Proposed Solution**

- Will learn more about System Design/Architecture and fill out the rest
